### Statement of Purpose
For busy people who canâ€™t water their plants, PiPlantPrecipitation APP to the rescue!

### Detailed Description

First Stage
Hardware moisture sensor connected to Arduino or Raspberry Pi should activate water pump

Second Stage
To be decided when we get there

Third Stage
To be decided when we get there

Nice to haves if time permits:
- Gather temperature and humidity data


### Equipment:
-jumper wires
-raspberry pi / arduino
-breadboard
-aquarium tubing
-water pump(s)


### List of sensors:
-Moisture sensor (prongy boi)
-DHT11 (temperature & humidity)
Nice to haves:
-light intensity sensor

### UI:
- Cute pixel art
-mint green, pink

### Responsibilities:

Mars
Hardware (Raspberry Pi version)
Methods to connect everything, read data

Shiv
Hardware, mainly electrical help
Database work

Reeg
Hardware (Arduino version)

Brandy
Python code, C++ code, UI and Art assets



### Brain Stormings:
>User should be able to enter optimum data
>Comparison of optimal vs sensor, accept or reject
>Water schedule super important, for instance, orchids should not be watered more than 2x/week
>5 points of data to determine optimal data
>watering categories / sunlight categories
